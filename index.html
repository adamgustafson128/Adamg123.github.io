	<p><font font-size="20" color="white"> I am a Physics student at the University of Georgia. Outside of the academic world, I am a songwriter, record producer, and writer. I was born in Sweden but have lived in the United States for more than 25 years. I grew up outside of Atlanta and went to UGA from there in order complete my first Bachelor's degree in Spanish. After that, my interest in music took full control and I moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue music full time. This was one of the best things I've ever done. I am now a multi-instrumentalist who composes, writes, and produces. I occasionally go on tour when time allows. Now, I have returned to the University of Georgia (GO DAWG!) in order to finish another Bachelor's degree, this time in Physics.</font> </p>
